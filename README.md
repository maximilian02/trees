# trees
A small project to implement tree data structure and operations around:

## Generic tree
- Search operation

## Binary tree
- Insert operation
- Search operation
- Depth First Search (DFS) traversals
  - Preorder
  - Inorder
  - Postorder
- Breadth First Search (BFS) traversals


# How to run?
I use [Code Runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) with VSCode. Just open binary.js or generic.js file and execute Code Runner to see the output.
